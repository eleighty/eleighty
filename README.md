# Welcome! :coffee:

I'm Emma Leighty -- a Microcomputer Support Technician for the SK School District. For the year of 2022, I was chosen to participate in a trainee program, educating myself in programming, networking, data engineering, and cyber security. I am currently taking this oportunity to work on learning C#, SQL, and Powershell, and am excited to track my progress as I become more educated in the programming world.
